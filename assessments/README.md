# All Springboard Assessments

This Repo contains all assessments from the Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp

## Assessment 1 Meme Generator
Made using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, this meme generator will take a link for the picture you would like to make into a meme as well as the top and bottom caption and create a meme to display on your screen.

## Assessment 2 Jeopardy
This is a more advanced show of basic front end technology mastery. The Jeopardy assignment calls on the jeopardy API, and loads a new jeopardy game depending 

## Assessment 3 Forex Converter
Using Flask and Python, I made a forex currency converter which used calls to a forex API to find conversion rates.

## Assessment 4 Playlists
This assessment introduced Databases to my set of skills, and demonstrates my fluency with PostgreSQL. Users can use the app made in this assessment to add songs to the database, and make their own playlists that will be stored in the database used by the app.

## Assessment 5 Lucky Numbers - Optional
This assessment was skipped in the interest of time.

## Assessment 6 Node.js Express Broken App
Rather than building an app from scratch, I had to read and understand another code base, solve 6 total issues, and refactor the app to shorten load times by simplifying expressions, and organizing axios requests using promises.

## Assessment 7 Even More Broken Express App
Along with a simple js problem, timeword.js, this assessment mostly involved another broken app with more advanced problems. There were 6 bugs in total, which this time included user issues, user verification issues, security concerns, and data schema implementation.

## Assessment 8 React Madlibs
Using React.js A single-page React app was made to call the madlibs api to gather new madlib information, display a form customized to the story, and then show the story on completion.

## Assessment 9 

This assessment links back end engineering with React to make an app that can remember users and passwords, and allow users to contribute to a food and drink menu, as well as view item details.


#### Personal Notes after Completing Assessment 2:

Here is my jeopardy project. This project took me a lot longer than I thought it would take purely because I had to identify things through trial and error. Many of the things I'm doing are not yet stuck in my memory, so I would find myself console.logging much of it right as I did it. I also took pride in much of the code, and opted to make it better as I revisited parts of it. For example, in the fill table function, each of the rows were coded out, and I decided to convert them into loops instead. I decided to do that in order to make the code easier to edit and more concise. 

Overall, it was as much a self-learning experience as it was an assessment, and approximately, it took me about 22 hours. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is the issue where the words come in big and then shrink to the size I specified in the css when the clues are clicked. I couldn't find where that was written. 

Thank you, I can't wait to put this to work for my own projects. 

A comment though: I could not have done this project without Promise.all or learning about .then. My knowledge of AJAX wasn't complete until I found those myself and then even later my mentor helped me truly understand AJAX. I really think Promise.all and .then should be taught to reinforce what is learned about AJAX, it would have saved me about 5 hours of fiddling around with async/await.
